            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <li>

                Passionate about artificial intelligence, software engineering, and data science, I specialize in
                designing and implementing innovative systems that harness the full potential of artificial
                intelligence. My expertise spans various domains of AI, including deep learning, natural language
                processing (NLP), computer vision, reinforcement learning, and generative AI. I have developed advanced
                models and applications for real-world use cases, such as language understanding, image generation,
                predictive analytics, and intelligent decision-making systems. Beyond technical development, I am deeply
                committed to exploring the latest trends and advancements in AI technologies, including explainable AI,
                federated learning, and multimodal systems. In a dedicated section called "Talks," I will share insights
                and valuable content about AI and cutting-edge technologies, focusing on their impact, challenges, and
                opportunities. This platform will serve as a hub to inspire and educate enthusiasts, professionals, and
                researchers in the evolving world of artificial intelligence. </li>
