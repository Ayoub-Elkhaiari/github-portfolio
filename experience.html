                <li>
                    <strong>LLM Trainer (Remote Tasker at Outlier)</strong><br>
                        Worked on creating prompts to test the limits of AI models, focusing on cases where their responses might fail.<br>
                        Reviewed AI outputs to check if they followed instructions, stayed truthful, and were well-written and culturally relevant.<br>
                        Compared different responses, ranked them based on quality, and explained why one was better than the other.<br>
                        Made edits to AI responses to fix mistakes and ensure they matched the given instructions.<br>
                        Adjusted prompts and Responses to make them more challenging, helping improve the modelâ€™s ability to handle complex tasks.<br>

                <li>
                    <strong>AI Engineer Intern, RMA (Royale Marocaine Assurance) ARZ Consulting:</strong><br>
                    Optimized LLMs with Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for insurance-related Q&A, enhancing model performance with lower computational costs and avoiding catastrophic forgetting.<br>
                    Implemented two chunking methods: Late chunking using Jina.AI for better document segmentation, ensuring accurate query responses and minimizing hallucinations, and Custom chunking with a linked list approach, linking small chunks to the longest chunk to avoid truncating text segments.<br>
                    Developed a HybridRAG system combining RAG with structured insurance data and GraphRAG, establishing relationships and dependencies between structured data to create a graph for precise, context-rich answers.<br>
                    Built a multi-agent system, including a Recommendation Agent to suggest relevant answers, a Language Agent to detect user language (French/Arabic/English) for tailored responses, a Translation Agent to translate between French, Arabic, and English using context-based prompt templates, and integrated Speech Recognition for enhanced accessibility and user interaction.<br>
                    Applied prompt engineering as an extra layer of defense against hallucinations in the pipeline, ensuring safety and accuracy for sensitive insurance queries.
