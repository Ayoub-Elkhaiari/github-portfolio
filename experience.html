                    <pre>
                        Worked on creating prompts to test the limits of AI models, focusing on cases where their responses might fail.
                        Reviewed AI outputs to check if they followed instructions, stayed truthful, and were well-written and culturally relevant.
                        Compared different responses, ranked them based on quality, and explained why one was better than the other.
                        Made edits to AI responses to fix mistakes and ensure they matched the given instructions.
                        Adjusted prompts and Responses to make them more challenging, helping improve the modelâ€™s ability to handle complex tasks.

                    <pre>
                        PEFT for LLM Fine-Tuning: Optimized LLMs with Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for insurance-related Q&A, enhancing model performance with lower computational costs, and avoiding catastrophic forgetting. 
                        Chunking: Using two methods:
                            - Late chunking: Jina.AI for better document segmentation, ensuring accurate query responses and minimizing hallucinations.
                            - Custom chunking: linked list approach, small chunk is linked to longest chunk to avoid truncating in the segment of the text.
                        HybridRAG: Developed a HybridRAG system combining RAG with structured insurance data and GraphRAG to get relationships and dependencies between the structured data resulting a graph for precise, context-rich answers. 
                        Multi-Agent System:
                            - Recommendation Agent: Suggested relevant answers from a predefined question pool.
                            - Language Agent: Detected user language (French/Arabic/English) to provide tailored responses.
                            - Translation Agent: is a sub-agent of the Language agent Translated between (French/Arabic/English) using context prompt template.
                            - Speech Recognition: Integrated voice queries for enhanced accessibility and user interaction.
                        Prompt Engineering: as an extra layer of hallucinations after the pipeline, ensuring safety and accuracy for sensitive insurance queries. </pre>
